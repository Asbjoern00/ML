The code is structered such that:
- The extended notebook "LandcoverClassification.ipynb" is provided in a seperate file
- The code for question 3 and 4 is provided in the notebook "code_3_4.ipynb"
- Both notebooks assume that the relevant data files "train.npz", "test.npz" and "dataset-vis-exam2022.txt" are in the same folder as the notebooks.
- Simply running all code in both notebooks will reproduce all plots and results. Plots are saved as .png files in the folder where it is run.
- All major steps in the code are commented.
